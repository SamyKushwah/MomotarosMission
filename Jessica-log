6/12/23 - talked as a group to decide the final plan for our game. Decided on roles for the project, mine focusing on UI elements 
6/13/23 - began working on finding backgrounds, sprites and deciding on an overal color scheme and vibe for the game. Began the editing of the start screen. 
6/14/23 - finished the start screen and level selection screen design. Added some functionality for clicking to advance to the next screen. 
6/15/23 - worked on allowing the screen to be resized to any dimensions. This involved figuring out what percentages each sprite should be in comparison 
          to the rest of the screen. Also began brainstorming the best approach for displaying coins for each level. 
6/19/23 - continued to work on resizing the screen fluidly and finding the correct proportions for every element. Implemented a way to read data from a save 
          file to assign the correct coin images for each level, decided to make the pause screen a blurred/lightened image of the current level with text 
          on top to display options to resume, restart, or go home. Began the design of level 1. 
6/20/23 - worked on enchancing image and text quality by recreating images with more pixels- did this for every screen. Changed pause screen to be a cloud 
          background and added links to resume, restart and home page. Attemped to start the design of level 1- still trying to 
          get a good design going. Brainstorming/trial and error for good design for win/lose screens
